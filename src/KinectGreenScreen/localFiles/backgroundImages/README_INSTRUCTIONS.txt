SUMMARY
This folder is a special location where key backgrounds and foregrounds can be placed for loading at runtime.  
The UI elements are resized to attempt to fit all images contained in this directory in for selection.

HOW GET IMAGES TO LOAD
1. Please name files in numerical order in how you would like them arranged starting from 1.  
2. Images should also contain information in their name if they are a foreground or background. So an image 1 with 
a foreground and background would be named 1_Background.png and 1_Foreground.png.  Dont forget to have alpha
in your foreground images so they can be seen through!
3. You can have just a background and no foreground if you want. You would only include the image labled background. 
So if image 2 has only a background only include 2_Background.png in the directory

HOW TO ACTIVATE GREYSCALE
If you have an old timey photo and want to active greyscale on the camera, also include that in your file names.
So if image 2 were greyscale, your image names (with a foreground and background) should be 2_Background_Greyscale.png 
and 2_Foreground_Greyscale.png.
